#Storing the women data in sample_women data frame

sample_women<-data.frame(women)

#Finding the average weight and height of the women in the data frame 

mean.height=mean(women$height)

#Finding the number of women whose height is greater than average and whose weight is less than the average and storing it in a new data frame

#There are no such women
